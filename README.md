📈 Project Workflow

1️⃣ Data Import

Imported customer churn dataset into RStudio
2️⃣ Data Cleaning

Converted TotalCharges to numeric format
Removed missing values
Checked data consistency
3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed analysis on:

Customer churn rate
Contract types
Monthly charges
Customer tenure
Internet services
4️⃣ Data Visualization

Created visualizations using ggplot2:

Churn by contract type
Monthly charges vs churn
Customer tenure distribution
Churn by internet service


📊 Visualizations

📌 Churn by Contract Type



📌 Monthly Charges vs Churn



📌 Customer Tenure Distribution



📌 Churn by Internet Service



🔍 Key Findings

📌 Month-to-Month Contracts Had Highest Churn

Customers without long-term commitments were significantly more likely to leave the company.

📌 Higher Monthly Charges Increased Churn Risk

Customers paying higher monthly fees showed increased churn behavior.

📌 Longer Customer Tenure Reduced Churn

Long-term customers demonstrated stronger loyalty and lower cancellation rates.

📌 Fiber Optic Customers Showed Higher Churn

This may indicate potential pricing concerns or service dissatisfaction.



💡 Business Recommendations

✅ Encourage long-term contracts through incentives
✅ Improve onboarding for new customers
✅ Introduce loyalty rewards programs
✅ Create pricing strategies for high-paying customers
✅ Investigate service satisfaction among fiber optic users
